# Final Satellite Image Storage Fix - Blob Solution

## Problem Resolved
The application was failing with "ArrayBuffer object could not be cloned" error when storing satellite images in IndexedDB. This occurred because ArrayBuffer objects cannot be directly serialized in some browsers.

## Final Solution Implemented
1. **Convert ArrayBuffer to Blob**: In `storeSatelliteImage`, convert the ArrayBuffer to a Blob before storage using `new Blob([arrayBuffer], { type: 'application/octet-stream' })`.

2. **Store Blob instead of ArrayBuffer**: Store the Blob object in IndexedDB, which is fully serializable and compatible across browsers.

3. **Recreate from Blob**: Updated `recreateGeoRaster` function to accept Blob and convert it back to ArrayBuffer using `blob.arrayBuffer()` when needed.

4. **Updated retrieval methods**: Both `getSatelliteImage` and `getAllSatelliteImages` now check for blob data and recreate both the georaster and arrayBuffer properties.

## Key Changes Made
- **ProcessedImage interface**: Added `blob?: Blob` property
- **storeSatelliteImage**: Converts ArrayBuffer to Blob before storage
- **recreateGeoRaster**: Now works with Blob input
- **Retrieval methods**: Recreate both georaster and arrayBuffer from stored Blob

## Files Modified
- `src/services/indexedDBService.ts`: Updated storage and retrieval methods
- `src/services/imageProcessor.ts`: Updated interface and recreateGeoRaster function

## Browser Compatibility
This solution uses Blob objects which are fully supported across all modern browsers and provide reliable IndexedDB storage for binary data.

## Testing Status
- âœ… TypeScript compilation passes
- âœ… Production build successful
- ðŸ”„ Ready for runtime testing with GeoTIFF uploads
